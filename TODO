ip Batch Output
---------------

Add option to output commands in a format that can be fed to 'ip -b'.
Consider which is the more useful case: with or without ip prefixed?
Possible name: '--(no-)prepend-ip-command'.
The conflict I see is that most people are not used to the ip batch
mode so outputting something you can just redirect to a shell script
is probably more common.

Change 'all' at once
--------------------

Specify a special name 'all'. When running commands, this name can be
used to execute the same acton for all entities of that type. For
example 'ns host delete all' to delete all hosts.
