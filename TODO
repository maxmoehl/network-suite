Batch Processing
----------------

Allow a file as input for commands. Commands should not be prefixed
with 'ns' in that case. Either via a flag '-b | --batch' or command
'batch'. Also include the option to force execution to proceed in
case of failure '-f | --force'.

ip Batch Output
---------------

Add option to output commands in a format that can be fed to 'ip -b'.
Consider which is the more useful case: with or without ip prefixed?
Possible name: '--(no-)prepend-ip-command'
