network-suite
=============

A shell script to emulate different network setups using network
namespaces.

Simple Network
--------------

Creating hosts and networks is simple:

    # ns host add host-a
    # ns host add host-b

    # ns net add subnet

Connect them with the host-connect command:

    # ns host connect host-a subnet 10.0.0.1/24
    # ns host connect host-b subnet 10.0.0.2/24

Now both hosts can talk to each other:

    # ns host shell host-a
    $ ping 10.0.0.2                                                                                                                                                                                                            ~
    PING 10.0.0.2 (10.0.0.2) 56(84) bytes of data.
    64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=1 ttl=64 time=0.223 ms
    64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=2 ttl=64 time=0.168 ms
    64 bytes from 10.0.0.2: icmp_seq=3 ttl=64 time=0.204 ms
    ^C
    --- 10.0.0.2 ping statistics ---
    3 packets transmitted, 3 received, 0% packet loss, time 2046ms
    rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 0.168/0.198/0.223/0.022 ms

For details on the different commands refer to the help output from
ns (you can also check the '__help' function in the script).

Design
------

ns is built as a wrapper around ip(8) from the iproute2 package.
As such, a lot of inspiration has been taken from that command. But
the interface overall is kept more simple for the sake of making the
script readable _and_ POSIX compliant. For example options have to be
in a fixed order instead of the key-value style of ip.

Internals
---------

To see what is happening behind the scenes use either '-v' to see
every single statement or '-d' to only print the resulting ip
commands without executing them.

Each host and each network are represented by a network namespace.
To separate the two kinds they get (mostly) invisible prefixes.
Networks are prefixed with 'nsn-' and hosts with 'nsh-'. This
prevents operations from changing the wrong entity.

For every network namespace the loopback interface is brought up and
for networks a bridge is created. When connecting a host to a network
a veth pair is created. One end in the host (named after the
connected network) and the other in the network (named after the
connected host). The network side has the bridge set as its master.

Future Work
-----------

See TODO for details on planned features.
